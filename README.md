# Temperature Converter
Learning C# by writing a temperature converter console app

## Goals
* **Learning how to write a program in C#**
* Familiarizing myself with Visual Studio

The project is structured on MS's official C# console app tutorial, found [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-console?view=vs-2019)
The tutorial covers how to make a calculator, I instead made it convert temperatures in Celcius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. 

## Usage
Look at the Releases on the right side. Download the .exe (for Windows) or the .dll (requires the .NET runtime on your compouter).
